# Frontend UI Updates — 2026-01-04

Summary of UI/UX tweaks made on 2026-01-04.

## Files changed

- **frontend/src/components/Layout.jsx**
  - Left / right column widths updated from `w-[70%]` / `w-[30%]` to `w-[75%]` / `w-[25%]`.

- **frontend/src/components/ModelComparisonView.jsx**
  - Added horizontal rulers above the Decision Tree and XGBoost sections (uses `border-t-2` with `UI_COLORS.divider`).
  - Reduced vertical spacing between top-level blocks (`space-y-6` → `space-y-2`).
  - Removed extra title-wrapper margins and added `mt-0` on `h2` headings so titles sit closer to the rulers.
  - Inlined the XGBoost heading and the "Base value" text onto a single line using a flex container.
  - Tightened paragraph margins (e.g. `mt-2` → `mt-1` → `mt-0` as appropriate).
  - Added `mb-6` to the XGBoost `<section>` to create more space below the section.
  - Inserted a small cohort SVG icon before the single-passenger cohort label in the header.
  - Fixed a small `h2` classname typo (`text-xlmt-0` → `text-xl mt-0`).

- **frontend/src/components/visualizations/SHAPWaterfall.jsx**
  - Local `formatPassengerDescription()` now uses `yrs` (e.g. `8 yrs female`) for shorter copy in the waterfall title.
  - Prepend the same cohort SVG icon before the waterfall passenger description so waterfall cards match the main header.

## Notes & follow-ups

- The `formatPassengerDescription` helper imported from `frontend/src/utils/cohortPatterns.js` was not globally changed (it was previously edited and then reverted). If you want the shorter `yrs` wording everywhere, update that utility too.
- To further tweak spacing, adjust these Tailwind utilities in `ModelComparisonView.jsx`:
  - Parent spacing: `space-y-2` (smaller) or `space-y-6` (larger)
  - Section internal padding: `p-2`, `pb-6`, etc.
  - Section external spacing: add `mb-?` classes to the `<section>` elements.

If you'd like, I can:
- Update `frontend/src/utils/cohortPatterns.js` to use `yrs` globally.
- Add the cohort icon to the Global Feature Importance header.
- Create a small visual regression note or screenshots showing the before/after.
