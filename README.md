# Titanic Survival – Explainable AI Portfolio Demo

Interactive Streamlit app showcasing **explainable AI techniques** for Titanic passenger survival prediction. This portfolio demo highlights UX design and data visualization skills for machine learning interpretability.

## 🎯 Features

### 💬 **Interactive XAI Explorer** (app_pie_version.py)
- **Two-column layout** – visualization on left (75%), interactive controls + chat on right (25%)
- **Tab-based model comparison** – switch between Decision Tree and XGBoost visualizations
  - **Decision Tree tab**: Interactive D3.js tree with donut chart nodes showing class distribution (81% accuracy, 60% recall)
    - **Proportional edge widths** – thickness represents passenger flow (1-32px range, sqrt scale)
    - **Donut charts** at each node – blue for died, green for survived with 50% center hole
    - Hover over nodes to see decision path from root with gold highlighting
    - Edge thickness legend for clear visual communication
  - **XGBoost tab**: SHAP explanations with dual waterfall visualizations (80% accuracy, 72% recall)
    - Global feature importance chart (25% width)
    - **Alternative waterfall chart** (50% width) - floating bars showing cumulative SHAP impact
    - Standard waterfall chart (full width below)
- **What-If Scenario controls** – interactive sliders and radio buttons above chat
  - Set Sex, Passenger Class, Age, and Fare to explore custom passengers
  - **Smart fare updates**: Automatically adjusts to historical average when class changes (1st: £84, 2nd: £20, 3rd: £13)
  - **Contextual hints**: Shows warning when fare/class combinations are historically unusual
  - Real-time tree path updates and SHAP value recalculation
  - Inline label layout for compact, space-efficient design
  - Automatically clears when preset buttons are clicked
  - Independent controls allow counterfactual exploration (e.g., "what if 3rd class paid 1st class prices?")
- **Tab-aware chat** – context-specific responses based on which model you're viewing
  - Decision Tree: Path explanations and survival statistics
  - XGBoost: SHAP explanations with typical passenger details (e.g., "female, 2nd class, age 30, fare £15")
- **Dark mode UI** – cohesive dark theme matching Streamlit's native chat interface
- **Natural language exploration** – flexible query parsing with intelligent cohort matching
  - Type queries like "show me a 40-year-old woman in 1st class" or "what about a young boy in 3rd"
  - Priority-based matching handles overlapping criteria (e.g., child > class > gender)
  - Helpful fallback messages for unparseable queries
- **4 preset patterns** – quick buttons for common cohorts (women, men, 1st class child, 3rd class male)
- **Dynamic updates** – both visualizations update immediately based on conversation or what-if controls
- **Fixed double-click bug** – unified state management ensures preset buttons work on first click
- **Scrollable chat history** – 300px scrollable container for conversation messages
- **Optimized layout** – reduced padding for maximum content visibility

> This project demonstrates **XAI (Explainable AI)** techniques with a focus on intuitive UX, interactive data visualization, and conversational exploration.

- **Inline control layout** – compact design with labels on same line as inputs
- **Human-readable labels** (decoded categorical features)
- **Dark mode design** with cohesive theming and smooth CSS transitions
- **Radio-style tabs** – eliminates visualization rendering bugs

## 🎨 Design Decisions

**Why 4 features for Decision Tree?**
- Original demo used 7 features, but `embarked`, `parch`, and `sibsp` had minimal predictive power
- Reducing to 4 core features (`sex`, `pclass`, `age`, `fare`) provides:
  - ~50% faster SHAP computation (critical for what-if scenarios)
  - Cleaner UX with fewer input controls
  - Better performance on free-tier hosting
  - Only -0.1% accuracy loss

**Why D3.js instead of Plotly?**
- Greater control over custom interactions and animations
- Demonstrates full-stack visualization skills
- Better for portfolio showcase (custom implementation vs. library template)
- Plotly fallback code included (commented out) for easy switching

**Visual Design Goals:**
- Immediate clarity: Active path vs. inactive paths
- Color coding: Green (survival) vs. Red (death) vs. Blue/Orange (split directions)
- Animation: Pulsing final node draws attention to prediction
- Responsive feedback: Smooth transitions create polished UX

**Donut Chart Nodes (app_pie_version.py - Default):**
- **Chosen as default**: Donut chart visualization provides clearer class distribution with reduced visual clutter
- **Key advantages**:
  - Immediate visual of class split at each node (e.g., 70% died / 30% survived)
  - 50% center hole reduces visual weight compared to filled pies
  - More information density without adding text labels
  - Aligns with common data viz patterns (donut = proportions)
  - Hover path highlighting shows decision flow from root to any node
- **Implementation details**:
  - Blue slice for died passengers, green slice for survived
  - Node size proportional to sample count (`Math.sqrt(samples) * 2`)
  - Inner radius at 50% of outer radius for donut effect
  - Gold color for hover highlighting (preset selections maintain proportional widths)
  - Edge labels offset upward on hover for better readability
  - Optimized label positioning (leaf labels on right, internal labels below)
- **Alternative**: Gradient node version (app.py) available for simpler aesthetic preference

**Proportional Edge Widths:**
- **Visual encoding**: Edge thickness represents number of passengers following that split
- **Scale**: `d3.scaleSqrt()` with range [1, 32] prevents extreme differences
- **Square root scale**: Balances visibility of small groups while showing hierarchy
- **Highlighted paths**: Maintain proportional widths to show passenger flow even when highlighted
- **Legend**: Clear explanation below tree title for user guidance
